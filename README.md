# What this project is about?
This project was created during my 1 term of my CS studies. It reads a file which contains a labirynth
* 0 - no walls
* 1 - right wall
* 2 - down wall
* 3 - right wall and down wall
After that it generates weights on edges between each of the labirynth's node (basically labirynth is a weighted graph) and searches for the shortest path in the given labirynth.
